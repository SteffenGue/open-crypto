        Extracts from the response-dictionary, with help of the suitable Mapping-Objects,
        the requested values and formats them to fitting tuples for persist_tickers() in db_handler.

        Starts with a dictionary of empty lists where each key is the possible key-name from a mapping.
        This is necessary because not every exchange returns every value that we try to store but a list
        is later necessary to fill up 'empty places'.
        i.e. Some exchanges don't return last_trade volumes for their currencies.

        TODO: prevent hardcoding key_names ( nice to have )

        Each Mapping stored behind response_mappings['ticker'] is then called to extract its values.
        i.e. The Mapping-Object with the key_name 'currency_pair_first' extracts a list which is ordered
        from first to last line with all the symbols of the first named currency.
        The return from extract_values() is then stored behind the key-name,
        e.g. the empty list is now replaced with the extracted values.

        The overall result of this process looks something like the following:
            first_currency =    ['BTC', 'ETH', ...]
            second_currency =   ['XRP', 'USDT', ...]
            ticker_last_price = []  <--- no Mapping-Object in exchange.yaml specified
            ticker_best_ask =   [0.123, 5.456, ...]
            ...
        Lists which are filled have the same length.
        (obviously because extraction of the same number of lines in response)
        The X-th elements from each value-list(extracted with Mapping-object) represent
        one 'response-line' in the given json.

        Because returning just the dictionary containing the lists is not intuitive
        the last step is formatting the extracted values into fitting tuples.
        This is done by using itertools.zip_longest() which works like the following:
            a = itertools.repeat('a', len(b))
            b = [1, 2, 3]
            c = []
            d = [1, 2]

            result:
                ('a', 1, None, 1)
                ('a', 2, None, 2)
                ('a', 3, None, None)

        We are using the length of currency_pair_first because every entry in general ticker_data
        has to contain a currency pair. It is always viable because the lists of extracted values
        all need to have the same length.

        The formatted list of ticker-data-tuples is then returned.
